## Deployment

"A Deployment provides declarative updates for Pods and ReplicaSets."

* we don't manage ReplicaSets owned by Deployments

> You describe a desired state in a Deployment, and the Deployment Controller
> changes the actual state to the desired state at a controlled rate. You can
> define Deployments to create new ReplicaSets, or to remove existing
> Deployments and adopt all their resources with new Deployments.
