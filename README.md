# kubernetes local labs tooling 🥼🧪

## minimal requirements 🧰

Your development machine must have enough RAM et processing power to run a
kubernetes cluster and various services and workloads.

For example, I am currently using a MacBook Air M1 with 8gig of RAM for basic stuff. But
I expect to be have to use a more powerful machine for more complex scenarios.
I will keep you informed!

### Docker platform (with Docker Desktop, please!)

> Docker is a software platform that allows you to build, test, and deploy applications quickly. Docker packages software into standardized units called containers that have everything the software needs to run including libraries, system tools, code, and runtime.
> 
  - [MacOs](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/mac-install/)
  - [linux (Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora)](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/linux-install/)
  - [Windows](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/)
    (requires WSL 2 backend enabled (free and built-in to Windows))  


## concepts 💡📜

knowing k8s basic concepts helps architecturing, building, and debugging.

[concepts](./concepts/README.md) section lists fundamentals kubernetes concepts.

Additional informative files are available via links peppered throughout!

## minikube 🧊

"minikube is local Kubernetes, focusing on making it easy to learn and develop
for Kubernetes."

"All you need is Docker (or similarly compatible) container or a Virtual
Machine environment, and Kubernetes is a single command away: minikube start"
